                An open letter to the NEC ...</p>
              In the not so dim and distant past, the landed Gentry of the
              Highlands, restricted resources to the local population forcing
              them to move to Glasgow and there by change their lifestyle.
              <p class="arial16">Now, in 1981, SHRG may yet let history repeat
                itself, by stifling their local branches of income, thus forcing
                them into a spiral of decline.</p>
              <p class="arial16"><u>Edinburgh SHRG,</u> appear to be in serious
                danger of losing their premises at Broughton St. due to
                financial pressure.</p>
              <p class="arial16"><u>Glasgow Branch</u> seem so content to wallow
                in the success of the new club that they have allowed the once
                exalted centre to deteriorate into a 'One May and his Record
                Player' Disco on Saturday nights. (All credit to Eddy et al who
                struggle on...)</p>
              <p class="arial16"><u>Rural Branches</u> face bankruptcy in
                attempting to pay for ambitious rural befriending schemes which
                are as costly as they are necessary.</p>
              <p class="arial16">All this might be excusable if SHRG was busy
                running expensive publicity campaigns or political lobbying.</p>
              <p class="arial16">Unless SHRG decides to support and build up the
                branches of the organisation, so that they might provide local
                bases for Gay action, we shall soon end up with a moribund
                centralist organisation serving only the Cities. What is needed
                is a re-allocation of finances and more effort from the NEC in
                respect of their local branches.</p>

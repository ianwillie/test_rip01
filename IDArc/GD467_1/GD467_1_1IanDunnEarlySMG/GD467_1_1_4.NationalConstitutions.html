        <p>SMG began in Glasgow early in 1969 and was formally constituted on 9 May at a meeting attended by 25 people. Occasional meetings were arranged, with much smaller attendances, for the rest of the year in Glasgow.</p>
        <p>THe first meeting in Edinburgh was on 22 August 1969 in the Mound Centrex which was then located at 8 North Bank Street. SMG was very experimental in the early days, and was considered to be an extension of the Church of Scotland's Moral Welfare Committee's fieldwork. These meetings, which became monthly in 1970, transferred to 52 Queen Street (the present Mound Centre) in May 1970. However the Group was asked to leave the premises by the end of that year because SMG had begun to pursue an independent policy.</p>
        <p>The meetings in Edinburgh were the only ones in Scotland in 197. Almost, abandoned, SMG won a lucky break when the Catholic Chaplaincy offered regular use of their premises in George Square from January 1971. The Edinburgh Branch was formed as a district Branch later that year and Community House, Glasgow, offered their address as a 'National Office' at about the same time.</p>
        <p>Thus the Group was established. Four of the original 6 founders are still active today in the Edinburgh Branch.</p>

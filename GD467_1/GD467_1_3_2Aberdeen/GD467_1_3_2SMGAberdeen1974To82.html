            from Alastair Black, Branch treasurer SMG Aberdeen. It was
            heartening to learn that you have plans to revive the Branch and I
            wish your effort every success.&rdquo; 2 page reply to a letter

            <P>1974/07/07 letter: 3pp. Angus to Ian [Dunn] re writers
            bisexuality &amp; a recent gay affair. <BR>&ldquo;I hope someday I
            can be more active in SMG nationally. At the moment Aberdeen needs
            all the time &amp; effort I can spare just to keep it going,
            although Mike Hanson's visit helped. Denis W soldiers on
            magnificently but too many of our members and potential members
            have problems real or imagined which make it hard to keep things
            going. Denis &amp; I are hardly the best disco organisers either
            by temperament or inclination.</P>

            <P>1976/03/03 Letter: Robin S to Ian Dunn.</P>
            <P>...&rdquo;The Aberdeen branch of SMG seems to be getting off
            the ground at last, I am happy to say. Our regular meetings now
            seem to be have a fairly steady attendance of at least a dozen
            [12].<BR>One thing disturbs me and I don't think that anyone in
            the group can answer my question; I would welcome advice. Nearly
            every meeting we get a new person along; usually young &ndash;
            frequently a student &ndash; and often deeply troubled and unsure
            and seeking help to find their feet &ndash; and we seem to have
            nobody trained to deal with this situation. I think the group
            should have someone trained in putting them at their ease and
            showing them that the group can help them sort out their problems.
            I know the group has helped me. Often these newcomers seem to be
            scared off and we lose any chance to help them.</P>

            <P>P16 <B>Gaze through The Press</B><BR>&ldquo;Over the last few
            years the gay movement had little press coverage in the north,
            until people in the area started to defy society by going about
            their everyday lives no longer hiding the fact that they were gay.
            During the past few months there has been some mention made of the
            taboo subject of homosexuality in the local papers; this has
            revolved mainly around three issues: the banning of six people
            from the Scotia Bar in Aberdeen; a series of articles on the
            Women's Liberation movement; and a request by the Scottish
            Minorities Group that Gay News should be available in the Aberdeen
            central library.<BR>[There follows an <A HREF="../../../Press/PressAndJournalAberdeen.html#CityBarDenies">account

            <P>The 'Scotia affair' made headlines news in the P&amp;J; we
            ourselves were interviewed, tough our story was subtly distorted &ndash;
            our spokeswoman, who comes from Essex, was reported as being a
            'Londoner', for example. We were encouraged by the amount of
            support we gained and several people, gay and non-gay, agreed to
            boycott the pub. We then decided to go one step further and on
            December 5<SUP>th</SUP> a group of twenty people began a picket
            outside the Scotia, distributing leaflets and putting our case to
            the customers. During the picketing three of our friends were
            assaulted by to customers and were taken to hospital &ndash; one
            had a black eye, one was hit about the head and chest and the
            other lost three teeth. The two mem responsible [names &amp;
            addresses given] were each fined &pound;25. In court their agent
            said, 'They are both the type of chap who dislike this kind of
            behaviour intensely and hitting them was the first thing to come
            into their heads to get rid of them.' 'The kind of conduct that
            has been described is not what the law regards as provocation.
            People may have views which are highly offensive to you, but that
            is no excuse for using the kind of violence used here'. The press
            coverage of these events had been surprisingly thorough and free
            from hysteria.</P>

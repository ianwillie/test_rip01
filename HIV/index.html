<p>  This text originally appeared as articles which were serialised in The Bulletin, the house journal of Body Positive Strathclyde.  It was published as chapter eight of  <a href="HIVAndAIDSFrankRice.pdf">Frank Rice, HIV AND AIDS
a brief history, 1998</a>. Frank died a few years ago and so far I have been unable to find his obituary.</p>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">For a time in the 1980&rsquo;s Edinburgh
  was known as the &lsquo;AIDS capital of Europe&rsquo;. This was so
  because HIV had spread rapidly throughout the drug using community
  there, through the practice of needle sharing, with the consequent
  inflation in the infection rate. It also explains why Scotland&rsquo;s
  initial experience of HIV, drug, rather than gay related, differed
  from that undergone elsewhere in the UK. By the 1990&rsquo;s however,
  more typical epidemiological patterns had established themselves in
  Scotland, with gay men being the largest category of infected persons. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The first cases of HIV infection in Scotland
  were recognised in 1984 amongst haemophiliacs, while routine HIV testing
  began in 1985. However, as early as 1982, a number of concerned people
  had decided collectively to &lsquo;monitor&rsquo; the situation. This
  was the genesis of Scottish AIDS Monitor, the founding trustees of
  which were Derek Ogg, Edward McGough, Nigel Cook and Simon Taylor.
  Medical services have over time been delivered in the Lowland of Scotland
  through two primary outlets &ndash; the Edinburgh City and Glasgow
  Ruchill Hospitals. In Glasgow&rsquo;s case, Ruchill had been the city&rsquo;s
  venerable fever hospital. It had been somewhat underutilised since
  the triumphs against TB and polio in the 1950's but was now pressed
  back into use. In 1994 Glasgow also opened an outpatient unit, along
  with a gay men&rsquo;s health clinic, The Steve Retson Project. at
  the Royal Infirmary. Leading Scottish HIV specialists have included
  Drs Ray Brettle, Clifford Lean and Sandy MacMillan at Edinburgh, Dr
  Tony France at Dundee and Drs Richard Hillman, Dermot Kennedy, Alan
  Pithie, and Anne Scoular at Glasgow. </P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The major player on the Scottish
  AIDS political scene between 1983 and 1996, in terms of advocacy, resourcing
  and prevention work, was the Scottish AIDS Monitor (SAM) Initially,
  it operated only in Edinburgh offering basic support services, but
  by the end of the 1980&rsquo;s, it had grown to include branches in
  Lothian, Strathclyde, Tayside and Highland. With Maureen Moore as its
  long term Chief Executive, SAM offered welfare rights, buddying, training
  and prevention work, The initial thrust of this prevention work &lsquo;was
  toward the heterosexual community but following pressure from the gay
  community, SAM&rsquo;s Gay Men&rsquo;s Project was launched in March
  1994.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Internal tensions led to the
  end of SAM Strathclyde funding in 1995, with the subsequent closing
  of its Glasgow operations in the autumn of that year. A similar &lsquo;shut
  off&rsquo; of funds in Edinburgh, resulted in the closure of Scottish
  AIDS Monitor in its entirety in 1996. A new agency, PHACE West (Project
  for HIV/AIDS Care and Education) spearheaded by, among others, the
  late Ken Cowan, Maureen Moore and John Wilkes, won funding in 1995
  for West of Scotland work, while early in 1996, Gay Men&rsquo;s Health
  took on the role of prevention work in Edinburgh. SAM&rsquo;s work
  in the Highlands had already been taken over by Reach Out Highland.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Over the years, a number of
  other agencies joined SAM and its successors in the fight against HIV
  in Scotland. There has been, for a while, a proliferation of agencies
  in Edinburgh such as the Waverley Trust, with its Solas Centre and
  Milestone House (Scotland&rsquo;s only AIDS hospice) and the sex workers
  groups Scot-PEP and SHIVA.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Glasgow has benefited from its
  HIV/AIDS Carers Support Group and from having a branch of ACET, (they
  also have a branch in Dundee). Also in 1991 an inter faith group was
  established out of which came the much loved Haven, the drop-in facility
  at Ruchill Hospital. Glasgow also has the Positive Accommodation Team
  and recently 'Food Line&rsquo;, and Networks, (an HIV and sexual health
  education group), have been established in the city.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">But no overview of the history
  of HIV and AIDS in Scotland is complete without reference to Body Positive.
  Body Positive had been established as an offshoot of the Terrence Higgins
  Trust in 1984, and certainly, by the end of the decade, an active group
  was operating in Edinburgh. Centres have also been established in Dundee
  and Fife.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It was John McClelland. for
  many years Chair of Body Positive Strathclyde, who took the initiative
  of establishing the group in Glasgow in 1988. Among other leading members
  in these early days were Kim Ferguson, Jamie McTaggart and the late
  Ken Cowan, Jamie Draper and Pat Gangel.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Initially, Body Positive Strathclyde
  consisted of a Wednesday night support group meeting in SAM&rsquo;s
  Glasgow offices. But, with the help of the late Steve Retson, by this
  time SAMs Strathclyde Project Manager, and of Eric Kay, who became
  SAM&rsquo;s first Gay Outreach Worker in Strathclyde in 1991, Body
  Positive Strathclyde&rsquo;s remit widened to include prevention work,
  complementary therapies, advocacy and the famous Millport weekends.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Eric Kay became Body Positive Strathclyde&rsquo;s
  first full-time Project Coordinator in 1993. A year later, in 1994,
  the group moved into its own premises in the basement of 3 Park Quadrant.
  In January 1995 the move upstairs to the present opulent premises took
  place.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In looking back over the history
  of HIV and AIDS in Scotland, it should be remembered that, in the Eighties,
  acquisition of an HIV diagnosis was a far more terminal prospect than
  may be the case now. There were no grounds for any optimism at all.
  Moreover, to 'go public&rsquo;, even in a discreet way, about HIV,
  was a tremendously risky thing to do at this time, with the popular
  press in full sanctimonious cry, and with the ever present risk of
  exposure of one&rsquo;s status. Furthermore, the self-empowering and
  self-enhancing ethos of Body Positive was threatening to some.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When these factors are borne
  in mind, then the courage of the pioneers of HIV and AIDS politics
  in Scotland, whether infected or affected is to be applauded: people
  such as the late Ken Cowan, Kim Ferguson, Eric Kay, Maureen Moore,
  John McClelland, Jamie McTaggart, Derek Ogg, the late Steve Retson,
  and all the countless others who stood up to be counted about HIV in
  Scotland.</P>

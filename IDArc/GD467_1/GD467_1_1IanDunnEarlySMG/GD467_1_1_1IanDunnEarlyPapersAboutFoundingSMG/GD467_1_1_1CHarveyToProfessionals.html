          SMG to Professionals regarding Needs of Homosexuals: 13 June
          1969</strong>,</p>
      <p class="closespacepara">Letter
            from T Colin Harvey, SMG Chair, to professionals who deal
        with homosexuals in difficultly: Jun 1969. <strong><font color="#FF0000">Copied.</font></strong> </p>
      <p class="closespacepara">... writing to you as someone concerned
        in a professional capacity with homosexuals in difficultly.&nbsp; ...
        SMG has been formed to consider the posision of the homosexual
        in Scotland.&nbsp;&nbsp; First task to discover what are the
        needs, social &amp; otherwise, of homosexuals. In course of work
        you will have formed views on this ... let me know in what way
        a group like ours&nbsp; can contribute to meeting them.</p>
      <p class="closespacepara">SMG consists of 15 people, most but not
        all homosexual men and women. Come togethere due to changing
        climate and &quot;partly because of the association of several
        of our members with the Albany Trust, with Esquire Clubs, and
        with the Monorities Research Trust<a name="MinoritiesResearchTrust"></a> [first
        mention of this: what is it?]. The bodies are principally active
        south of the Border only.&quot; </p>
      <p class="closespacepara">Group, form own experience, conscious
        of social isolation. Some specialist counselling available in
        larger cities, group would like to know if the social needs of
        homosexuals are being met, and precisely what these needs are.</p>
      <p class="closespacepara">&quot;The group is willing to organise
        itself to meet these needs, but we should value the opinion of
        persons like yourself before taking any action. The Group includes
        a Lecturer in Social Work (myself), a Minister of the Church
        of Scotland, a Glasgow solicitor, two teachers and an estate
        agent and several Civil Servants. From within our resources we
        anticipate that we could get sufficiently organised to unertake
        education, liaison with other bodies with similar aims, to press
        for Law Reform, and perhaps some sort of supportive work for
        the homosexual in difficulty. But we are particularly anxious
        to learn what other people see to be the needs in this field.</p>

          Prof Mental Health, University of Aberdeen to C
          Harvey: 17 June 1969</strong> </p>
      <p class="closespacepara">Interesting letter, poses questions he
        finds difficult to answer. He does not see representative sample
        of hss, intensive psychotherapehutic approach meets with limited
        success. Few patients have really expressed any with for a change
        in theire [sexual] attitudes. They have sought help for cirumscribed
        problems like depression, panic states, alcoholic addiction etc.</p>
      <p class="closespacepara">One group - students who fear they are
        homosexual but are in fact heterosexual - experience satisfactory
        results on whole, at least possible for them to overcome their
        fears.</p>
      <p class="closespacepara">Usual referral is from Courts or breakdown
        of a a serial love affair with possible suicide. Normal problems
        of homosexual, including social isolation seldom come the way
        of psychiatrists.</p>
      <p class="closespacepara">So, he feels ignorant of depth &amp; range
        of problems. He would welcome more enlightenment. Suggests establish
        the facts of everyday life foe homosexuals to give a baseline
        to people like himself.</p>

        the matter,&nbsp; if this is in order. </p>

        more homosexuals who are open about status and accept it as normal
        to be in group in future. Would like to circulate replies to
      his letter amongst pwople. </p></td>

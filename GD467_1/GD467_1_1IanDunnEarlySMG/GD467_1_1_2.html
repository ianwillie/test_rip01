      A full meeting of the Scottish Minorities Group was held at the
        Mound Centre, Edinburgh from 8pm to 10pm on Friday, January 9th
        1970. The meeting discussed and approved for circulation, a new "Aims

        out by SMG amongst its members. Both of these documents accompany

      Copies of the Albany Trust's "Social Needs Survey" were received,
      and all members present completed a questionnaire. The Secretary
      undertook to post questionnaires to members who were not at the
      January meeting. Anyone who has not yet sent his completed copy
      to the Albany Trust is urged to do so immediately. Everyone will
      be affected to some degree by the results of this important research.<br />
...<br />
"The Glasgow Herald", on December &nbsp;6th 1969, refused to publish
an advertisement announcing the Albany Trust research. No mention was
made of the SMG in the proposed announcement. The Editor did not accept
Secretary's invitation to explain this censorship. <br />
...<br />
The Chairman wrote to Douglas Allan, Secretary of the Church of Scotland's
Moral Welfare Committee, on Dec 10 1969, asking for a measure of support
in our efforts to publicise the Albany Trust's research. The matter was
discussed at a meeting ... Jan 13 1970. The committee decided not to
endorse publicity, but made it clear, however, that their representative,
the Rev Ean Simpson, should continue to attend SMG meetings and should
be generally available for counselling. The group's activities are being
closely scrutinised.</td>

    </strong>  <strong>Letter from Norman Dunne to Mr Farthing.</strong>&nbsp; [link
    note Actioned 19 Sep 1970]</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">[Headed] The Bachelor Clan, , B.C.'Box 12,
    1070 Dumbarton Rd, Glasgow. [with application form listing 55 special
    interests to tick]</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Dear Mr Farthing.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">You may , like myself, have been irritated on
          occasion by the often well-meaning but occasionally vicious
          use of the phrase "Well, and when are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> thinking
          to getting married?" As if a fellow has to think of getting
          married. I for one don't think of it particularly. I'm content &nbsp;as
          I am with my bachelor status. And if I do someday decide to
          consider the prospect of marriage, then the decision will be
          my own, and in my own good time. My choice of bachelorhood
          is my concern, no one else's. And I wish that folk would recognise
          this and leave well alone.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Yet I know that's asking too much. So in Scotland
          I launched the BACHELOR CLAN to counteract this attitude. Mutual
          defence? Or just a natural desire for congenial and like-minded
          comply? For there's no doubt that I enjoy company. It;s certainly
          not because I',m a recluse that marriage doesn't figure in
          my list of priorities. It's more because I simply like things
          as they are, and wan to keep them that way.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Nevertheless &nbsp; it's true that the number of
          single persons I know is more limited than the number of married
          couple. So a BACHELOR CLAN seemed a good idea. It was meant
          to bring into contact with those who share my own outlook
          - and that would already be progress towards companionship,
          and eve friendship.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The Clan at first was limited in its outlook.
          It was a Scottish Clan for Scottish lads. And the response
          was immediate. In fact, the Clan is now definitely part of
          the Scottish Scene.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">It was this response which convinced me that
          we ought to extend our frontiers and look beyond Hadrian;s
          Wall. Our success nationally suggest that many other fellows
          would welcome the opportunity to use our services.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">I have been acting as a kind of director and ensuring
          that the right kind of folk are introduced to each other.
          Already I have met several discreet and compatible characters
          through correspondence. I think that you might benefit in this
          way too. An it's certainly worth a try.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The catch? Don't be too cynical. You may have
          been caught before and have now learned to be wary. But this
          is a genuine attempt to meet a need. I really do want to help
          - and help YOU. But - year, you are right, of course - I do
          need money to finance the operation. A membership fee of two
          pounds should be ample and necessary to defray the cost of the
          overheads. The more members, the more costs will be shared,
          and the better the service we'll be able to offer each other.
          So you may like to discuss this with your present bachelor
          friends before reaching a decision.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">When you have done that, send me the two pounds
          and I'll have you enrolled right away in our BACHELOR CLAN.
          Scotland has made a success of it. I'm convinced that in your
          area too there are chaps who would welcome the opportunity
          of getting to know you. If, when writing, you use the enclosed
          numbered lists to let me know your interests, it will help.
          In that way I'll be better able to see that you're suited.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">If you prefer to play safe, just send a stamped
          addressed envelop for further details. the CLAN had nothing
          to hide - and doesn't wan to anyway. So join us and share the
          benefit of clan membership. And give us the want to share
          the benefit of your company too.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Yours very sincerely,</font></p>

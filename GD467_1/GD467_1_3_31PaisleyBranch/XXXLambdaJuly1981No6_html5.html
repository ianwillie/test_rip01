                  the summer as of July the 8th, it would be hoped that some

                <p>TREASURER TAKES DRAMATICALLY<br>
                  ILL AT COMMITTEE MEETING&gt;<br>
                  As a result of a proposal by the branch chairman to lower the
                  tea and subs. money from 40p to a set rate of 30p for all, the
                  treasurer could be seen to turn white and visibly collapse at
                  the shock, especially when the motion was carried.
                  Unfortunately the treasurer could not vote against his horrid,
                  vile, disgusting and sickening motion, having been struck dumb
                  (no comments please) when originally proposed.</p>
                <p>ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING<br>
                  October the 7th, has been set aside for the AGM. Time 7pm.

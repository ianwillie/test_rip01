                    <p>Following after the Daily Mail's exhaustive
                      revelations concerning British Layland, we have uncovered
                      startling details of a cash fund set up by Glasgow SMG.
                      The existence of this fund, for a long time suspected,
                      has now been confirmed by two of Glasgow's part time workers
                      who have been persuaded to reveal all. Not a pretty sight.
                      In a 'NEWS' exclusive we can now detail the full workings
                      and history of this hitherto unpublished episode.<br />
    Secretely discussed in March of this year, the final details of the fund
    were completed in April.<br />
    One of the two main conspirators in setting up the fund (codenames D.D. and
    P.G.) was knocked down in mysterious circumstances while s trolling at night
    on the M8. The vehicle concerned was later discovered to be associated with
    the Company now under investigation by the Prime Minister, British Leyland.<br />
    The fund operates in this manner. Members of SMG (codenamed 'sponsors') agree
    to pay, usuall from secret bank accounts but sometimes in used notes, various
    sums of money per month for a period of one year. In return they receive
    'Sponsor Cards' entitling them to free access to all SMG events.<br />
    Money from this fund is used to improve the facilities, modernise and redecorate
    the club in Sauchiehall St. which the Scottish Daily Express Editor, Charles
    Graham, so fearlessly exposed in February.<br />
    Now in its third month of operation the total sum of &pound;240 has been
    received by the operators of this fund. Now there are twenty-five regular
    Sponsors donating &pound;122.50 per month to SMG.<br />

            secret fund, the Committee stated:<br />
&#8220; We are indebted to all those helping us through this system and allowing
            the work to go ahead on the premises.&#8221;<br />
            SHADOWS SIEGE<br />
            Shadows Discotheque at the Western Hotel was invaded by a group of
            teenage thugs recently. This gang, mainly female and numbering around
            twelve, forced an entry and assaulted members and staff, hurling abuse
            and insults before being removed. The police were not involved.<br />
            This form of provoccation and unnecessary violence is no stranger to
            Glasgow although rare at organised gay events. It is to be hoped that
            such incidents do not become common place and that this type of violence
            will not stop people from enjoying themselves at the Western Hotel
            in future.<br />
            COMMUNITY HOUSE<br />
            It is with much regret that we learn of the forthcoming closure of
            Community House. It is to be hoped that the valuable work of the House,
            as both a Day Centre and evening Meeting Place can be continued in
            Glasgow. SMG Glasgow expresses it heartfelt thanks (cont.)<br />

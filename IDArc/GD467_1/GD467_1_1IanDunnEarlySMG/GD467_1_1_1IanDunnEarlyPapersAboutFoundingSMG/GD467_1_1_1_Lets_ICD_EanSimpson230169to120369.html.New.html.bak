      <p <strong="">Letter Ian Dunn to Ean Simpson, 23 Feb 1969,<br>
        ***--&gt; 7 Hillside Cresc, Prestwick. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="closespacepara">... writing following meeting between Antony
        Gray, Mrs Cordell &amp; myself in London on Fri 14 Feb [1969].<br>
        .... [which] arose from earlier meeting with friends concerning the
        position of the homosexual in Scotland. We had been put in touch through
        the Esquire Clubs via former Chairman Colin Harvey. We are also Albany
        Trust supporters.</p>
      <p class="closespacepara">Antony Gray gave address in (leave off the 'Rev'
        for cases) &amp; that of Mrs Raby. He regrets that he has not read Ean
        Simpson's article in "Life and Work" last summer, nor the subsequent
        correspondence. </p>
      <p class="closespacepara">"We have arranged to meet once more in my
        parents house in Glasgow (yes, they know why) on THursday March 8th
        [1969]. I hope we will agree to work within Albany Trust freamework. We
        dont want to become like those irresponsible groups referred to in the
        "New Society" issue of August 29 1968." Toney Trey wishes to visit
        Scotland this spring &amp; hopes that Moral Welfare Committee [of CoS]
        will come to some decisionsk &amp; invite the Trust up to Edinburgh for
        discussion. ...</p>
      <p class="closespacepara">Yours sincerely,[Ian Dunn] </p>

      <p></p>
      <p class="closespacepara">"Many thanks for your welcomd epistle." ...
        liked the tone of letter - pleased to know that things are beginning to
        move in Scotland -social acceptance in S nill - dust of centuries
        beginning to stir with hefty lobbying - CoS condeded last year that
        homosexuals should be allowed the right to be homosexuals: over age of
        consent &amp; expressed sexual desires in private.</p>
      <p class="closespacepara">He had been counselling homosexuals in West of
        Scotland: approach simple: simple, as far as male goes, if he is a
        homosexual which a long conversation will elicit, then he urged him to
        be the best sort (discriminating, but wholehearted in his
        homosexuality). If he is not really a homosexual ie a heterosexual by
        birth and has been denied this expression &amp; used homosexual outlets,
        he persuades him of this.</p>
      <p class="closespacepara">Would like to meet Ian Dunn's group. </p>
      <p class="closespacepara">He has just been nominated chair of Presbetery
        Committee of Moral Welfare &amp; with that&nbsp; a seat on National
        Committee - he has vested interest in Antony Gray coming to Scotland as
        guest of this committee. ID could supply useful data to back up his
        case. </p>
      <p class="closespacepara">Yours aye, Euan (Rev.) Ean M Simpson. </p>

      <p class="closespacepara">..."may I say that I found Thursday's meeting
        most heartening and encouraging. It is good that there is a responsible
        group actually getting down to <u>doing</u> something. And I am glad to
        be associated with it! </p>
      <p class="closespacepara">He was doing 70mph down side of Loch Fyne when
        he remembered that he had not asked Colin Harvey for his address. He
        wished all reliabe information about Esquire Clubs &amp; Colin is the
        man to provide. He would like to be considered as a member of the group
        and would be pleased to help in any practical way. He has an elecric
        Gestetner Duplicator - "ultra-modern" - will run off any circulars.</p>

      <p class="closespacepara">"Sorry for delay - unavoidable - but at least
        you can tell your father that I did not find your [Ian Dunn typed them]
        pressure on the keys too heavy since (as you can see for yourself) the
        final result seems quite legible! </p>
      <p class="closespacepara">Tells ICD not to be too alarmed by Antony Gray's
        expressions of alarm &amp; despondency. He will have a private word with
        Colin Harvey and will speak to Mrs. Raby.</p>
      <p class="closespacepara">He had read over the Esquire litterature from
        Alan Horsfall &amp; was not convinced of the efficiency of the
        organisation. Suspects they did not lay groundwork plans carefully.
        Suggests avoiding this trap, getting max coordination &amp; support from
        powerful bodies. Will see ICD on 2 April&nbsp; Yours aye, Eun.</p>

      <p class="closespacepara">Suggest foolscap paper as his donation to Group
        subscription.</p>

        spelling liaison/liason, won't/wont, </p>
      <p class="closespacepara">First key letter being sent out. He
        does not object to it going to AT/Esquire/MRT/"Washington Mattachine".
        Curious to know why he wants to keep up connections with suspect Esquire
        crowd. [What does this mean?]. He has no personal objection to the word
        "club" but the CoS will refuse all recognition if they as much as have
        the suspicion of Club connotations. "Oh I'll remain a member alright -
        but I'll be amember with no backing from an official body!</p>
      <p class="closespacepara">Suggests keeping minutes as objective as
        possible - few personal observations&nbsp; better. </p>
      <p class="closespacepara">He told Antony Gray that he objected to his
        frail excuse for not travelling N of border.&nbsp; Seemed to think that
        he epected Kirk to pay his fare. </p>

      <p class="closespacepara">Feeling a lot happier - looking forward to next
        month's meeting in Andrew Melville House.</p>
      <p class="closespacepara">Has replied to New Society article. Main points.
        "An informal circle of individuals, not seeking solely to satisfy its
        own pleasures, is I am certain, an answer for most urban areas. In
        Scotland there is already such a group which has had successful meetings
        and lively discussions. This group does not meet under a homosexual
        label, which is obviously right in the different Scottish situation." He
        adds that he expressed his surprise about how easy good contact was with
        organisations offering help to people in distress. "This is a two way
        process and meeting withing a group modifies and clarifies one's own
        approach to the many difficulties of the homosexual."</p>
      <p class="closespacepara">Frank Kameny (Washington) [Mattichine?] asks why
        Manchester Club failed: lack of patronage &amp; customers, if so how was
        it manifest?</p>
      <p class="closespacepara">Jim , our friend in Edinburgh conducting himself
        with distinction.. Bob Thomson, Secy Scottish Council for Civil
        Liberties hopes to come to next meeting if NCCL conference in LOndon
        does not stop him. Andrew Davenport is a hostel/community worker
        metioned by Jim in his last&nbsp; letter.Andy has interview with Colin
        Harvey for Jordanhill [training?]. He is well educated in the matter of
        male sex problems: would somoeone of his general type be suitable for
        'our' purposes. If not accepted he will likely join girl friend in
        London.</p>

        report on feeling of polarisation between clubs and reform. Asks Albany
        Trust to show deeds not words and Antony Gray says that it is up to CoS,
        Douglas Allan &amp; EJS to make sure Trust gets a chance of acting in
        Scotland. Hence his trip to Edinburgh gunning for 2 medievally minded
        committeemen in danger of upsetting things.</p>

          misunderstood."&nbsp; Goes through letter of 24 June 1969 point by

        <p class="closespacepara">With his report included "Secretary's

          other Edinburgh information.</p>
        <p class="closespacepara">ICD shocked that EJS thinks SMG members have
          been placed on a Mailing List. "You" in FK's last letter refers to
          collectively AT, NW-HLRC, MRT &amp; SMG. "My goodness!" He has never
          divulged an address to anyone and will never.</p>
        <p class="closespacepara">FK's suggestions not for public opinion but
          appeared as report to meeting of 16 July 1969.</p>
        <p class="closespacepara">EJS links word extremeist by implication when
          discussing Law Reform with SMG. Not too diespoent as some Tories hold
          Socialists to be extreme and v.v.</p>
        <p class="closespacepara">"Can I put your resignation down in item (8)
          on the Agenda?" Ill pay him glowing tribute, and encourage sending of
          criticism of SMG's activities. He suggests that EJS thinks that an
          upstart SMG is trampling all over his work for law reform, which Ian
          points on it is not. </p>

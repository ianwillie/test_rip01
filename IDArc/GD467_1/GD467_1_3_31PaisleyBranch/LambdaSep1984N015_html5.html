      <p><u>TOBY JUG NEW OWNER DOES'NT WANT GAYS</u>      <br>
        After meeting (and drinking) in the Toby Jug for several years local
          gays were surprised to learn that the new proprietor, Mr Danny McDonald
          has made it clear that he does nto want gays in his bar. The trouble
          is he cannot identify then unless they are pointed out to him. <br>
          Anyway most gay people in the area have decided not to go back to the
          pub in any case.&nbsp;&nbsp; See you in the Brabloch ......... [cf

      <p><u>CHICKEN OF THE EGG?</u>&nbsp; <u>AGE OF CONSENT OR DISCRIMINATION?</u></p>
      <p>... gays can scarcely be contnet with the present situation
        which allows marriage at 16 yet refuses to contenance any expression
      of exuality between people of the same sex until they are 21 (then only
        in private).<br>
        ...</p>
      <p><u>Changing attitudes<br>
        In the long run</u> changes in the law are instrumental in changing people's
        thinking.<br>
        We have come a long way since the pre-<a href="../../../Press/GlasgowHerald/GlasgowHerald1940To70.html">Wollfenden
        [Report 1964]</a> days but
        we have stagnated and we have a long way to go. A further change in the
        law regarding the age of consent (if we have to have an age of consent)
        is an essential pre-requisite for a more healthy climate in sexual matters.</p>

      <p><u>STRATHCLYDE POLICE QUESTION GAY MEN IN GLASGOW</u>      </p>
      <p>We have heard that at least 10 men have been questioned
      in Glasgow recently regarding under age sexual activity. The police were
        alleged to have told one man that he would be prosecuted if he had a
      relationship with any male person up to his 21st birthday. They also informed
      the man's employer who has subsequently brought pressure on him to resign.</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p></td>

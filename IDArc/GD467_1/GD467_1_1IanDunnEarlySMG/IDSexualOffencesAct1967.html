            <P CLASS="text-body-indent" STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">I heard
            earlier in the year that the Society would welcome suggestions
            from the Public, in the ultimate hope that Scots Law might be kept
            in line with current thinking.</P>
            <P CLASS="text-body-indent" STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">The SOA1967
            ... Royal Assent 27 July 1967 &ndash; a major legal and social
            breakthrough, for the private life and difficulties of the adult
            male homosexual then ceased to be ruled by the crippling
            surveillance of the criminal law. But not in Scotland.</P>
            <P CLASS="text-body-indent" STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">I am in some
            genuine doubt about the present legal status of male homosexuals
            in Scotland, and would, with respect, ask the Society to examine
            the whole position.</P>
            <P CLASS="text-body-indent" STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">Recently, a
            questioning note from an &ldquo;admitted&rdquo; homosexual
            domiciled in England. He wondered whether it was &ldquo;all right&rdquo;
            to come across the Border &ndash; even for a short visit. Is there
            an answer to this very real worry?</P>

            <P CLASS="text-body-indent" STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">I was in touch
              with the office on the telephone on Monday, and this letter
              follows from the very short converstation I had with your
              courteous secretary, who gave me your name.</P>
            <P CLASS="text-body-indent" STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">My enquiry sprang
              from the prominent coverage given to your Committee's recommencations
              to the forthcoming General Assembly in Friday's &quot;Glasgow
              Herald&quot;. [<a href="../../../Press/GlasgowHerald/GlasgowHerald1940To70.html#ChurchUnderstand">10
              May 1968</a>]&nbsp; Your conclusions about the condition of male
              homosexuality do you credit, and are applauded. Their ring
              of understanding and compassion sounds worlds away from
              the reactionary decision of last year's Assembly.[Counter-motion
introduced            which deplored the prevalence of homosexual practice...
              cf GH article above.] Unnecessary, perhaps, to add that
              this must have impaired the Church's position - a position
              today which was painfully reflected in the &quot;Talkback&quot; production
              from Glasgow, though I would readily agree that this was
              an unsatisfactory programme on several counts.</P>
            <P CLASS="text-body-indent" STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">I know this is
              a very busy time for the Church, by my question is: have
              any approached been made to the Law Society of Scotland
              since the Sexual Offences Act 1967 became law?</P>
            <P CLASS="text-body-indent" STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">On my own initiative,
              I wrote to their Secretary in <a href="#29Dec67IDLawSoc">December
              1967</a>. After a further enquiry at the end of February, I learnt
              that he &quot;was endeavouring to ascertain the circumstances
              under which it was decided that the Sexual Offences Act
              1967 should not be made applicable to Scotland&quot; (REF L.S.222).
              I should be very interested to hear if your Committee have
              had any success in the legal direction. I, myself, have
              heard nothing more from the Law Society.</P>
            <P CLASS="text-body-indent" STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">I am sure you
              know of the existence of the Albany Trust in London. The
              Trust has absorbed most of the work of th Homosexual Law
              Reform Society and, since that major reform, has become
              very active, and indeed the work-load is heavy on funds
              <u>and</u> staff. If you not already in contact with Antony Gray,
              the Trust Secretary, I can say with certainty that he would
              welcome your approaches. Very probably you have a copy
              of his pamphlet &quot;Christian Society and the Homosexual&quot;.</P>
            <P CLASS="text-body-indent" STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">If you would
              prefer to wait until the Assembly has risen before contnuing
              this correspondence, I will understand. One can only hope
              and pray for an informed chande of attitude. For nearly

      <P CLASS="text-body-indent" STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">In the United
        Kingdom, since the 1967 Law Reform, events have taken a slow
        turn. Attempts to establish Social Clubs (&Agrave; La Amsterdam), are
        not proving an easy matter - there seems to be quite a bit of
        public antipathy. The Albany Trust has done, and is doing, a
        great job of education and conselling work, but is finding support
        is falling away now that the main &quot;battle&quot; has been won. (But
        not in Scotland, where it remains a crime to be homosexual).</P>

        all the Directors.</P>
      <P CLASS="text-body-indent" STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">On the following
        Sunday, the BBC presented a sympathetic report on &quot;The spread
        of homosexual clubs in Britain&quot; in the Radio 4 prgramme, 'The
        World This Weekend'. The following Wednesday on the same station
        in 'THe World at One', Lord Arran bitterly attacked the clubs
        and expressed the hope that they would fail. He also attacked
        them on the same day in his regular colum in the London <u>Evegin
        News</u> and said that, had he known that&nbsp; this was going
        to happen, he would not have introduced his Sexual Offences Bill.
        He attacked yet again in the same paper on the following Wednesday
        and on the 19 September the <u>Evening News</u> published the
        following letter from the secretary of ESQUIRE:- </P>
      <blockquote>

          worked in the field of homosexual law reform for longer than

          for homosexual clubs.</p>
        <p class="text-body-indent" style="margin-left: 2cm">&quot;We at Esquire
          CLubs regreat that it is necessary for minorities to be organised
          in this way, byt homosexuals at the moment are misunderstood
          and misrepresented to an extent that they <u>need</u> the particular
          support and protection that only the proposed clubs can give
          them.</p>
        <p class="text-body-indent" style="margin-left: 2cm">&quot;We will
          continue to work and pray for the time when the clubs are no
          longer needed when the homosexual can take his place in the
          wider community, but for the present we are simpley not prepared
          to sacrifice this generation for the sake of the next.&quot;</p>

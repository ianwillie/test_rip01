  "</span>THE SCOTSMAN, August 6 1976<br />
  Dear Sir,<br />POLICE AND INDECENCY<br />Your
fron-page report (Scotsmn, JUly 31 [1976]) of the conviction of a
Glasgow District Councillor for indecently assaulting a policeman makes
sorry reading. &nbsp;... raises several questions.<br />First, why was it
felt necessary to detail two young policemen in plainclothes to keep
surveillance on a public lavatory? Surely the occasional but regular
presence of a uniformed office and/or police car would have been a
better deterrant to those who commit a nuisance. This, and the youth of
th two plainclothes men suggest that the police were using "agents
provocateurs".<br />THe remarks of P.C. Sheils that he could "take
observations" of the adjoining lavatory cublice through a hole in the
wall are particularly distasteful. IF that cubicle was being used by a
perfectly lawy-abiding person would PC Sheils have been committing an
offence by taking observations? <br />...</td>

          <td><p>1 Dec 1977 handwritten letter from one [named] imprisoned
              in this case </p>
            <p>... You must realise that I cannot write everything down
              that I would like to say, as all letters are censored and
              one's life can be made miserable because of the charge.
              I would like to say ... I instructed my solicitor to pleas
              guilty to a lesser charge, which he failed to do. ...I
              have never felt happy the way my Solicitors did things
              ...<br />
  Also during the trial ... to the right of the judge, there is a door
  which has a glass porthole in it . Outside looking in ws the only crown
  witnesses, which was two policement, one of which was PC... and by
  his actions looking to us three accused, he was informing the other
  policeman , our names and in order to how we were sitting in court,
  for identification purposes before they gave evidence.<br />
  I am bit guilty to the charge, but I am guilty to a much lesser charge.<br />
          I got the other persons permission to include his name, to
          this letter, with information regarding him, but the whole
          page has had to be rewritten, because the prison authorities
          haere refused this letter to go out, until I had removed the
          other persons name from the letter, ever though I had his permission
          to do so.<br />
  I was sentenced to 12 months on &nbsp;... 1977. It would appear because
  of prison rules, I can't write names to you, if this is meant to be
  British Justice they can keep it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I can only rely on you to start something going, at Crown
              Office, and the Secretary of State. I write as I think,
              not as other people want me to?</p>
            <p>Thanks [name given]</p>
            <p>Is it possible could you visit me?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>... I expected my solicitor to get in touch about an appeal,
              but no, I had no word from them, I thought they would look
              after my interests, but I see I was mistaken.</p>

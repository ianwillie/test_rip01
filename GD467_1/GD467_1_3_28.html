<P>SMG Glasgow News <BR>&ldquo;<B>1<SUP>st</SUP> June 77</B> &ldquo;The
committee of SMG Glasgow intent on keeping in touch with its members
and providing greater involvement in decision-making, will be
<B>publishing this news-sheet each month</B>. With the aim of
providing a more localised form of information and comments, this is
no way intended as a substitute for SMG News which you will still
receive.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<B>EXCLUSIVE:</B> <BR>Following after the Daily Mail's
exhaustive revelations concerning British Layland, we have uncovered
startling details of a cash fund set up by Glasgow SMG. The existence
of this fund, for a long time suspected, has now been confirmed by
two of Glasgow's part time workers who have been persuaded to reveal
all. Not a pretty sight. In a 'NEWS' exclusive we can now detail the
full workings and history of this hitherto unpublished episode.</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Secretly discussed in March
of this year, the final details of the fund were completed in April.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">One of the two main
conspirators in setting up the fund (codenames D.D. and P.G.) was
knocked down in mysterious circumstances while s trolling at night on
the M8. The vehicle concerned was later discovered to be associated
with the Company now under investigation by the Prime Minister,
British Leyland.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The fund operates in this
manner. Members of SMG (codenamed 'sponsors') agree to pay, usuall
from secret bank accounts but sometimes in used notes, various sums
of money per month for a period of one year. In return they receive
'Sponsor Cards' entitling them to free access to all SMG events.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Money from this fund is used
to improve the facilities, modernise and redecorate the club in
Sauchiehall St. which the Scottish Daily Express Editor, Charles
Graham, so fearlessly exposed in February.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Now in its third month of
operation the total sum of &pound;240 has been received by the
operators of this fund. Now there are twenty-five regular Sponsors
donating &pound;122.50 per month to SMG.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">When asked for their comments
on the existence of this secret fund, the Committee stated:<BR>&ldquo;We
are indebted to all those helping us through this system and allowing
the work to go ahead on the premises.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><B>SHADOWS SIEGE</B><BR>Shadows
Discotheque at the Western Hotel was invaded by a group of teenage
thugs recently. This gang, mainly female and numbering around twelve,
forced an entry and assaulted members and staff, hurling abuse and
insults before being removed. The police were not involved.<BR>
This
form of provocation and unnecessary violence is no stranger to
Glasgow although rare at organised gay events. It is to be hoped that
such incidents do not become common place and that this type of
violence will not stop people from enjoying themselves at the Western
Hotel in future.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><B>COMMUNITY HOUSE</B><BR>It
is with much regret that we learn of the forthcoming closure of
Community House. It is to be hoped that the valuable work of the
House, as both a Day Centre and evening Meeting Place can be
continued in Glasgow. SMG Glasgow expresses it heartfelt thanks
(cont.)</FONT></P>
<P>(cont.) and its gratitude to the staff and Members of the Iona
Community for their invaluable help and assistance. SMG Glasgow is
fortunate in having its own premises to move into but it is important
to remember that there are many groups using Community House who do
not have such facilities. The disappearance of Community House after
33 years of devoted and practical social work, providing for those in
need is a tragic loss to Glasgow's Community.</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><B>Gay Handicapped Group<BR></B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">Those
who are physically handicapped in any way very often have their full
human rights restrained and their access to facilities reduced
through thoughtlessness and lack of proper planning. It is sufficient
to show only an intent and willingness to help, when asked, but a
more positive attitude is required when offering assistance.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Glasgow
SMG is prepared to provide all the help and facilities at its disposal
in the formation of a Gay Handicapped Group. Should any of you know of
anyone who is interested, whether disabled or not, in assisting with
such a group then please contact Paul gale at SMG Glasgow, or ring
the Advisory service, tel. 041-332-3382, on a Monday evening.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><B>OPEN HOUSE</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>The
new premises at 534, Sauchiehall St. were the scene of an Open House
meeting on the evening of the 24<SUP>th</SUP>. May. Around forty
members came along to inspect the premises and see the work being
undertaken. To those not prepared to poke around behind the
plasterboard paneling few dramatic changes or improvements were to
be noted. However, considerable work  has been carried out towards
the opening date in August. The plumbing is nearly complete, despite
the temporary setback which allowed the Charing Cross Hotel to
advertise for a short period running water in EVERY room.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Our
resident 'Live Wire' (Aaagh!), Donald Blaney has nearly completed the
electrical installation which will be the envy of Blackpool
Illuminations once this intricate task has been completed, the work
of renovating the Meeting Room can continue. BS was in
attendance and creating a very [column break] busy bar atmosphere
with a plentiful supply of drink  and the not unexpected packets of
crisps. SMG Glasgow would like to thank all those who attended and
made it such a successful evening.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Next
week the Community Industry Team will move in again to transform the
meeting room hopefully within a few weeks. Once the work of lowering
the ceiling and demolishing the dividing wall is complete , the
remaining work is mainly cosmetic, ie. Plastering, painting and
decorating. The closure of Community House makes the completion of
this work even more important and it is the intention of the Glasgow
Committee to open the premises to the public as soon as possible.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><B>DISCOS<BR></B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">At
short notice the Reo Stakis Group have unexpectedly and inexplicably
cancelled all SMG discos at the Charing Cross Hotel. Glasgow Branch
are still waiting for a reply to their letter to the Group and are
withholding further attention until they receive more information.
This decision leaves the disco list rather depleted, however it is as
follows:<BR>
Wed 1<SUP>st</SUP>. June  .  .   Spankies  .  .  . 
60p/&pound;1<BR>TUES 7<SUP>th</SUP> June  .  .  Tiffanies  .  . 
75p/&pound;1.25<BR>WED 22<SUP>nd</SUP> June  .  . Spankies .  . 
.60p/&pound;1<BR>SAT 25<SUP>th</SUP> June  .  .  . Clachan Pub,
Paisley</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">For
further information on any of these or other events, phone 332-3382
any evening. Please help support us by coming to these discos.
Profits from the first Spankies disco will to to the Gay News
Fighting Fund. Due to the success of the previous Paisley disco Bill
Machonachie has arranged a further event which it is hoped some of
the Committee will attend!</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">RATES
RELIEF<BR>
The Glasgow SMG premises at S St have been awarded
discretionary Rates Relief by Glasgow District Coulcil. This is due
to the invaluable counselling work carried out by the premises by the
Glasgow Gay Advisory Service under the guidance of Ian Millar. Most
of us realise the great value of the work carried out by the Advisory
Service but this is recognition from an unexpected source and worth
around &pound;2000 per year. Carry on the good work.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">GAY
NEWS APPEAL<BR>
Thanks to the excellent efforts of the Gay News Appeal
Committee and of Verner in providing a venue &pound;150 has been sent
to London for the Fighting Fund. A full list of forthcoming fund
raising events is included in a separate enclosure. Please support
Frank Rice and his team by attending as many of the events as
possible so that we can all assist Gay News in its forthcoming Court
battle. </FONT>

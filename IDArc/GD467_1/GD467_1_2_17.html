            by Bryan Teixeira (Vancouver social worker and theologian
            currently working towards his PhD in philosophy.<BR>&quot; <I>...In
            the Middle Ages, the leper was a social text in which corruption
            was made visible: ... an emblem of decay. Nothing is more punitive
            than to give disease a meaning — that meaning being
            invariably a moralistic one. Any important disease whose causality
            is murky, and for which treatment is ineffectual, tends to be
            awash in significance. Susan Sontag, </I><B>Illness as Metaphor</B>,

            summarises the stigma, cost of treatment, the causative
            organism.<BR>"
            ... It must be clear from the above that AIDS
            is not a &quot;gay disease". It is most likely a virus that
            spreads by the sharing of blood-based secretions, whether sexually
            of via blood and blood products.</P>

            <P>Scottish AIDS Monitor (SAM) Annual Report 1991/92<BR>"<B>About
            SAM</B><BR>Scottish AIDS Monitor is Scotland's national HIV
            charity. Since 1983, we have been combating the HIV problem in
            Scotland by providing preventative HIV education and by offering
            emotional and practical support to people with HIV and those close
            to them. SAM is supported by a professional staff team, numerous
            consultants, and 250 volunteers deploying services based in
            Lothian, Strathclyde, Tayside and Highlands. SAM is a large agency
            which nonetheless stresses the personal approach, the practical
            solution, and the primacy of the individual.<BR>SAM is core funded
            by the Scottish Office Section 16 grand, with additional funding
            for locally based projects being provided by Health Board and
            Social Work sources. Shortfall to cover projected expenditure is
            made up from public fundraising, including the Hardship Fund for
            people with HIV, which currently distributes more than &pound;20,000
            per year in individual grants to people experiencing financial
            difficulty in their illness.<BR>In its nine years of existence,
            SAM has grown from a small group of concerned individuals to a
            large and respected agency in the field of HIV and AIDS. A measure
            of the account that is taken of SAM's experience and expertise can
            be gained from the fact that SAM's Director was one of the two
            voluntary sector representative invited to join the Secretary of
            State AIDS Task Force, which produced its report and
            recommendations in 1992.<BR><B>THE SAM PHILOSOPHY</B><BR>At all
            levels, SAM aims to empower people with HIV disease to take the
            lead in making informed choices about their lives. Our approach to
            direct service provision is client-led, and counseling and
            befriending is offered on a non-directive, non-judgemental basis.
            SAM's philosophy in the fields of prevention is bases on a harm
            reduction principle; we do not, for instance, believe that
            abstinence to be a realistic choice for most people in protecting
            themselves from HIV, and our work with drug users is aimed
            primarily at encouraging safer injecting and alternatives to
            injection.</P>
            <P><B>Training and Support</B><BR>This year could be seen as one
            of steady development. National development continued with the
            production of training materials such as the <I>Buddy Training
            Manual</I> and guides to <I>Family Support Groups, Counseling Drug
            Users,</I> and <I>Women and Contraception</I>. The number of SAM
            internal training videos increased with topics covering
            heterosexual HIV spread, and violence within relationships. The
            system of facilitation was further refined and SAM's National
            Facilitators meeting highlighted not merely their need for support
            but the need to try co-facilitation, facilitators have time out,
            and looking towards ending their work.</P>

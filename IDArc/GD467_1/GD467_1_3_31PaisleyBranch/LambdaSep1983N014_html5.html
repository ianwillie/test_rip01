          Renfrew &amp; Ayrshire Gay Newsletter No 14 [November 1983]<br>
          extracts:
      </p>
        <p class="arial16" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" lang="en-GB"><u>Inverclyde
          Gay Group</u> - has lively meetings every Thursday 8pm in the Co-op Halls,
          Roxburgh St., Greenock.</p>
        <p class="arial16" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" lang="en-GB"><u>Kilmarnock
            Gay Group</u> - a small informal group meets every Monday in the
            Kay Park tavern, London Rd., Kilmarnock.</p>
        <p class="arial16" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" lang="en-GB"><u>RAGS
            TO RICHES?</u> Renfrew &amp; Ayrshire Gay Switchboard is desperately
            short of money and more importantly <u>PEOPLE</u>. <br>
            This is a valuable local service - almost everyone of us has used
            it at sometime - so it's worth support both financial and otherwise.
            ...</p>
        <p class="arial16" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" lang="en-GB"><u>PAISLEY
            DISCOS</u> The recent Hallowe'en disco held jointly with the Paisley
            Student GAYSOC was enjoyed by all and provided a little profit for
            the Switchboard - There's no details as to when the next one will
            be but EARLY NEW YEAR would seem likely. These events are an enormous
            effort to organise and provide little financial reward unless well
            attended. Please try to support them!</p>

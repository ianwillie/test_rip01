                      barred</p>

                      http://www.gaymonitor.co.uk/esquire1.htm. There is nothing
                      on The Knitting Circle about this. </p>
                    <p class="closespacepara"> ...<br>
                      We think that this is a good time, particularly for the
                      benefit of newer members, to outline the ESQUIRE
                      development from its inception.</p>
                    <p class="closespacepara">The Northern Homosexual Law Reform
                      Committee was founded in 1964 to campaign for the
                      abolition of legal sanctions against private homosexual
                      acts. ... passing of Sexual Offences Act in 1967 the
                      Committee, while convinced of the need for further
                      improvements in the law, began to turn its attention to
                      the many social problems still facing homosexuals.</p>
                    <p class="closespacepara">It was at this stage that the
                      Committee (C.) was approached by Reg Kilduff who asked it
                      to take over the Rockingham Club from him and initiate an
                      extended clubs project. The C. was interested and
                      sympathetic, but felt that it should first seek to
                      establish how great the need for such a development was.</p>
                    <p class="closespacepara">Accordingly, a series of
                      advertisements was placed in the personal columns of a
                      number of local newspapers - "Have you a homosexual
                      problem? - Ring Bolton 63961." The response was immediate
                      and overwhelming. Whereas a number of the inquiries came
                      from maladjusted homosexuals who were clearly in need of a
                      counseling service which could offer long-term support,
                      the overwhelming proportion came from homosexuals who were
                      adjusted to their condition but who were suffering from
                      severe social isolation.</p>
                    <p class="closespacepara">It became clear, then, that this
                      isolation was widespread and that it was particularly
                      acute in the smaller towns and rural areas. The need for a
                      clubs project was established as both necessary and
                      urgent. THe C. accepted this need, but felt that it was
                      not itself properly constituted to carry out this work.
                      ... a limited liability company was needed for this
                      purpose, hence setting up of Esquire Clubs Limited, all
                      the Directors of which were nominated by the Northern
                      Homosexual Law Reform Committee. ... to allay people's
                      doubts ...C. invited Mr. Jan de Groot &amp; Mr. J. W.
                      Makveld of C.O.C. in Holland to address two meetings in
                      Manchester, one for social workers and the other for
                      ESQUIRE members ... Reg Kilduff wanted £7,000 for purchase
                      of Rockingham club building which was exorbitant. ...
                      affiliation proposals to continue ...<br>

                    <p class="closespacepara">... following Wednesday Lord Arran
                      bitterly attacked clubs &amp; expressed hope that they
                      would fail. He also attacked them in his regular column in
                      the London <em>Evening News</em> ... had he known that
                      this was going to happen, he would not have introduced his
                      Sexual Offences Bill. He attacked again next Wed in same
                      paper.</p>

                        for homosexual clubs. </p>
                      <p class="closespacepara">We at Esquire Clubs regret that
                        it is necessary for minorities to be organised in this
                        way, but homosexuals at the moment are misunderstood and
                        misrepresented to an extent that they <u>need</u> the
                        particular support and protection that only they
                        proposed clubs can give them. </p>
                      <p class="closespacepara">We will continue to work and
                        pray for the time when the clubs are no longer needed
                        and when the homosexual can take his place in the wider
                        community, but for the present we are simply not

              Law Reform Committee.] </p>
            <p class="closespacepara">Thank you very much for October's
              Newsletter and the photocopy of Ray Gosling's "New Society"
              article. ... Your newsletter puts in words what I have felt since
              the summer - that there is an extraordinary lack of interest in
              homosexual matters just now. By this I mean the establishment of
              Social Clubs 'à la Esquire [sic]', and the like.</p>
            <p class="closespacepara">It would seem that if we assert our
              equality in the community - and enjoy the security and ease of
              equals - there is a hostility, a sort of"well, of <u>course</u> I
              would work for Law Reform and removal of social injustice, but
              regulated gay clubs? No <u>sir</u> - youre on your own"&gt;. At
              least, I've found so. Perhaps I can illustrate this in my
              communication with the Church of Scotland. In May 1968 the Social
              and Moral Welfare Committee announced that it would ask the
              General Assembly to reverse it's 1967 motion that (in effect)
              homosexuals were to be pitied as perverts and man (women were not
              mentioned) without moral control. (!) . Douglas Alan,Secretary,
              was the prime mover and I wrote to him and offered my support.
              (Earlier the C. of S. telephonist was <u>most</u> embarrassed: "<u>What</u>
              did you say your enquiry was about?") The Assembly just reversed
              last years ruling by 445 votes to 420. However, in August Mr Allan
              "wasnt available" by phone or letter. I wanted to get in touch
              with him as he has met Anthony Grey on one or two occasions, and,
              as I was going to visit the Albany Trust early in September, I
              wanted to take with me some concrete news of homosexual
              developments in Scotland. I was unable to do this, and Tony Grey
              was in Holland at the time of my visit.</p>
            <p class="closespacepara">I'm concerned too at the long silence from
              32 Shaftesbury Avenue, and am half frightened to write in case I

            <p class="closespacepara">However, like yourself, I am ultimately
              optimistic. I have written to the Mattachine Society of
              Washington, and hope to get an up-to-date idea of what's happening
              in the USA. I have been invited to have a talk with the Rev James
              Day, Assistant, Religious Programmes, BBC Television Scotland.

            <p class="closespacepara">I am very pleased to write and tell you
              that the fears expressed in my letter of 22nd December were
              unfounded.</p>
            <p class="closespacepara">Colin Harvey replied to my second letter
              (1st one recd OK, but pressure of work caused a delay), and I have
              spent a most enjoyable evening with Colin &amp; his marvelous wife
              at their house in Milngavie.</p>
            <p class="closespacepara">I expect the names Bert Henry, Donald
              Brook, Jim Halcrow will be familiar to you through correspondence.
              Colin and I hope to have a meeting of the 5 or us in Glasgow on
              26th January [1969] to decide what action we should take and to
              gather information (badly lacking) about the Scottish position.</p>
            <p class="closespacepara">I would like to keep you informed, so no
              doubt you will get another letter quite soon!</p>

                    <p class="closespacepara">Dear Jim Halcrow,</p>
                    <p class="closespacepara">A letter from a stranger - but, I
                      hope, not an unwelcome nor unexpected one!</p>
                    <p class="closespacepara">I, too, have been in touch with
                      Colin Harvey via Allan Horsfall/Esquire. In fact on Friday
                      night I spent a most enjoyable evening with Colin &amp;
                      his wife (children safely in bed!) at Milngavie.</p>
                    <p class="closespacepara">Colin tells me that you have been
                      in contact with him, and it seems that you and I have had
                      similar aims with your correspondence with various bodies
                      (C of S: - you, the Chairman; me, the Secy eg) One of the
                      minor tragedies is that we havnt met, and without Esquire
                      probably never would have had that chance. (Have you read
                      Bryan Magee's "One in Twenty"?).</p>
                    <p class="closespacepara">The point of my letter is: are you
                      free to come to Glasgow on Sunday evening 26th January?
                      The meeting place hasnt been fixed yet. Colin hopes that
                      he, yourself, myself, Donald Brook &amp; Bert Henry will
                      be able to come.</p>
                    <p class="closespacepara">Obvious "business" will be to
                      settle whether or not we establish some sort of committee
                      (I've volunteered, tentatively, to act as secretary) and
                      it's title. Much else will arise, no doubt. Will we only
                      be concerned with homosexual men, or with lesbians as
                      well? How is the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 being
                      used in Scotland since July 1967? What about local
                      "indecency" bye-laws?</p>
                    <p class="closespacepara">Your comments on these - and on
                      may other points - will be most valuable Jim. </p>
                    <p class="closespacepara">Will be keeping you informed,/

                      following our meeting on 21st March [1969] and I am now
                      authorised to confirm that we would like to accept your
                      king offer of the use of a room in your centre. [Where?]</p>
                    <p class="closespacepara">I am prepared to meet a few of the
                      people who have been referred to you by psychiatric
                      hospitals (the Albany Trust will continue to make its own
                      arrangements) in an attempt to assess what would be
                      expected of my group. If you think this would serve any
                      useful purpose, we can discuss how this might be arranged.
                      I am principally interested in the needs of those who are
                      exclusively homosexual because of the difficultly, which
                      some social workers have, in accepting the absence of
                      heterosexuality. </p>

                      supporter was prevented from attending) has been formed in

                      Scotland". Suggested title: The Scottish Minorities
                      Committee. It is intended to hold another meeting, in
                      Glasgow, on May 9 [1969], to which interested "A3" readers
                      will be welcome.</p>

                      Church of Scotland. - Please write to Mr J. Halcrow, 15
                      Rossie Place, Edinburgh 7. Mr Halcrow has asked for our
                      views on the proposed title. We think it is a good one,
                      and hope that this new group, like the women's social
                      groups, will be able to collaborate with the Minorities
                      Research Trust, and of course with "Arena Three," for the
                      general benefit of all homosexuals.</p>

                      'Congress' for discussion on the next agenda. Colin's idea
                      is to take over a hotel for the weekend, invite guest

              of the meeting on Feb 7th. Splendid account Also for the <u>very</u>
              interesting letter from the States. <br>
              How about writing to Allan Horsfall to tell him about the meeting.
              He might know of some more interested parties.<br>
              Delighted to hear about Herriott-Watt. </p>

                Harvey to Ian Dunn</strong>.<br>
              Thanks for the excellent report of the 2nd meeting.Keep bashing
              out this sort of material I am sure it is valuable - no, essential
              - as it is the first step in keeping people in touch.<br>
              I like the "Scottish Minorities Committee", and it will be
              interesting to see what the others think.<br>
              Just a small point, but the last line on p.1 should really read "
              A.T. and Esquire supporters in Scotland". I think that five of
              those now on the committee (you, me, Bert, Donald, Jim) met
              through Esquire and are Esquire supporters.<br>
              It may be that the new committee should assert its independence of
              both Esquire &amp; Albany Trust at this stage, until it is clear
              with whom - if with anyone - it wants to associate itself.<br>
              THe literature was very interesting. Best wishes, Colin.<br>

              volunteered&amp; I has referred me to the university. </p>

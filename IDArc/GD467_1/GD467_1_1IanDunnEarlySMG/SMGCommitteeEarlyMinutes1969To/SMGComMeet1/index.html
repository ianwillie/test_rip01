          TO DISCUSS THE POSITION OF<br>
          THE HOMOSEXUAL IN SCOTLAND</u></p>
        <p>The Meeting was held in Glasgow 7-10pm on
          Friday 7 Feb. 1969 in Ian Dunn's parents' house<font color="#ff0000">]</font>.
          Five were present: Ian Dunn, Jim Halcrowe,
        Ted MacDonald, Bert Henry, Donald Brooks.</p>
        It was hoped that agreement could be reached on the formation
          of a committee, what it should do, and its title.
          For various reasons no firm agreement was reached. Being virtual
          strangers,
          much time was taken up reading assembled correspondence,
          and exchanging personal experiences. It was all too easy to wander
          - conversationally
        - down interesting side roads!
        <p>We keenly felt the lack of someone with <u>experience</u> at
          the meeting. At future meetings we hope to have
          Colin Harvey, the former NW-HLRC Chairman, and someone with a
          legal background
          present. As we expand and make contacts, we hope
          that this will be a diminishing problem. Much discussion centred
          round the
          idea of giving any committee we set up a Charitable
          Status. Jim Halcrowe will "explore" this. About a dozen
          titles&nbsp; were
          proposed. It was decided to exclude reference
          to "Law Reform"
          for this will only be a first aim - support (from other
          Scots we hope) must be on a continuing basis. The word "Homophile"
          was rejected. We were unable to decide upon "welfare" or "counseling",
          "association" "society" or "committee".
          Donald Brooks wanted some association with the Albany
          Trust. The pros and cons of
          this were discussed. Ian Dunn agreed to ask Anthony
      Grey for reaction/support when next in London.</p>        
        <p>ACTION DECIDED UPON:</p></td>

      <td><p>(i) Next Meeting THURSDAY 6 MARCH 1969 (possibly same place
        - this is another problem to resolve!)<br>
        (ii) J.H. and D. B. contact
        as many others as they reasonable
        think will contribute to the work,<br>
        (iii) I.Q. see Anthony Grey in London on Friday 14 February.</p>
        <p>As we didn't appoint office bearers, I decided to distribute
          this as "the man holding the fort".
          I have also enclosed a copy of a letter recently
          received from the President of the Mattachine
          Society of Washington D.C. Purely for info to
          show the different
        mode of approach in the U.S.A. Was read out at the meeting.</p>
        <p>Kind regards,</p>        <p>[manuscript note]

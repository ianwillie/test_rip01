          From SMG, National Office, 60 Broughton St., Edinburgh<br>
          Gordon Graham (lapsed member) [added in pen]<br>
          Dear Gordon, <br>
          Your letter dated 13 November [1975] to the National Chairman has been
          passed to me for action.<br>
          It has been decided that we should send out a special notice of the
          meeting to Paisley members only, provided that there are enough
          members who are willing to carry on. Can you let me know the number of
          paid up members of Paisley Branch who are willing to carry on? John
          Breslon mentioned in the passing that your renewal hadn't come in yet.<br>
          If sufficient people are still interested, I shall ask John to run off
          the notices and send them to you and I shall let you have some money
          for envelopes and postage.<br>
          Yours sincerely,<br>
          Jim Halcrow.</p>

        <p><a name="let7mar1979"></a>Letter: 7 March 1979,[ a carbon copy of the
          original]<br>
          From: National Secretary, 60 Broughton St., Edinburgh.<br>
          Dear Friends,<br>
          I have been asked by the National Executive Committee to write to you
          to say how pleased we are that you have established an informal gay
          group in Paisley. Let's hope that your welcome initiative is followed
          by SHRG members in other parts o Scotland, where there is no local
          branch.<br>
          The National Executive is very happy to allow you to use SHRG in your
          title, but in granting permission, we make two conditions. They are
          (1) that the National Executive is provided with a copy of any
          constitutional document or details which you bank requires of you when
          you open a bank account; and (2) that, if at any future date, members
          of the Paisley Group with the constitutional arrangements to be made
          more formal, the National Executive will then require a constitution
          in the lines of Section F of the National Constitution to be adopted.<br>
          I am sure that you will appreciate that while we are satisfied with
          the present situation, the National Executive has to take the
          long-term view and safeguard its position to protect the interests of
          our members in the future. Neither you nor we can tell how the Paisley
          Group will evolve.<br>
          May I wish you all the best, hope that the future which does evolve is
          a successful and happy one to the benefit of all homosexual people in
          Paisley.<br>
          Yours sincerely,<br>
          Colin Sinclair, National Secretary.</p>

        <p><a name="Meeting14Nov1979"></a>SHRG PAISLEY GAY GROUP MEMBERS MEETING
          Wednesday 14 November 1979<br>
          Additional papers not typed: on pink paper Agenda, Contact Person's
          Report, Financial Report</p>
        <p>Present: SHRG National Executive Observers:- <br>
          M Crowe, Chairman National Executive<br>
          D Jago, Chairman Glasgow Branch<br>
          D Dawson<br>
          The number of members attending the meeting was 21. of which 11 were
          members of SHRG. Apologies were received from 4 members.<br>
          The meeting commenced at 2005.<br>
          Bill McConnachie apologised for the delay in starting the meeting.
          This was due to the fact that David Dawson (who had promised to get
          copies of the Agenda, financial statement/report photo-copied, had not
          arrived). Also David had promised to Chair the Meeting, if this was
          acceptable to the Members.</p>
        <p>Malcolm Crowe and David Jago were introduced to the company. In the
          absence of David Dawson it was suggested that Malcolm Chair the
          Meeting. Malcolm agreed to do so.</p>
        <p>The <span lang="en-GB">Chairman</span> read out the Agenda and asked
          Bill McConnachie for a report on the progress of the Group. This was
          given and the Chairman asked for questions. As there were no questions
          the Chairman suggested that it be accepted.</p>
        <p>The Chairman called for the Financial Report and Statement to be read
          out. This was done by Bill McConnachie. The Chairman asked if there
          were any questions. There were none.</p>
        <p>Before going on to the main motion the Chairman pointed out that the
          decisions made at this Meeting would be binding on the Group and that
          nay funds on hand should be retained under the control and decision of
          the majority of the Members and no subsequent claims would be
          entertained by a minority of the Group.</p>
        <p>The Chairman then called on Archie McCracken to propose his motion.
          Archie proposed: “That this group applies to become an official Branch
          of SHRG, as soon a possible”. The motion was seconded by Bob Wallace.</p>
        <p>The Chairman asked if anyone was against the motion.</p>
        <p>Derek Colville opposed the motion and submitted an amendment that we
          form a Paisley Gay Group. This was seconded by Jim Cameron.</p>
        <p>Derek said “It was the minority of the Group who wished to join SHRG.
          Some members do not wish to join SHRG at the present time”.</p>
        <p>Bill McConnachie replied: “Anyone who had a point to make, should
          make it on their own behalf”.</p>
        <p>Jim Cameron then said the Meeting was announced as Members of SHRG
          only. “There must be many Members who had not come to the Meeting
          tonight because they were not Members of SHRG”. He asked why SHRG was
          in the Title of the Group as he had understood that the Group was
          known as the Paisley Gay Group. Malcolm Crowe explained that, in a <a
            href="#let7mar1979">letter from the National Executive, dated 7
            March 1979,</a> permission had been given to use SHRG in the title
          of the Group provided that the National Executive was given details of
          any constitutional document and if, at any future date, Members of the
          Paisley Group wished the constitutional arrangement to be made more
          formal, the National Executive would then require a constitution, in
          the lines of Section F of the National Constitution, to be adopted.
          The Chairman said: “As to the status of Members it was up to those
          present to decide what they wanted. Anyone who has been at previous
          meetings can vote tonight. It is the majority of those attending the
          Meeting who decide what happens to the Group”.</p>
        <p>Derek, in support of his motion, stated “It is a small step instead
          of a large step. We prefer to be an informal Group. The SHRG Members
          here wish to break-away from the Paisley Gay Group”.</p>
        <p>Jim Cameron objected by saying that there was nothing wrong with the
          present Group except that it had no formal constitution. He went onto
          declare: “The time is not right for forming a new Group”.</p>
        <p>A vote was then taken on the amendment. It was overwhelmingly
          defeated.</p>
        <p>Archie then said, in support of his motion: “It would be advantageous
          to the Members to have the back-up of SHRG, including the legal
          aspect”.</p>
        <p>A vote was taken on the main motion which was carried by 16 votes to
          4 with 11 SHRG members voting in favour and 1 voting against. Two
          letters were received by the Meeting, from SHRG Members who were
          unable to attend. Both indicated their agreement to forming a Branch
          of SHRG.</p>
        <p>A Draft constitution was circulated and it was suggested we meet
          another time to discuss it fully. The Chairman said: “We are
          effectively calling an AGM”. It was then decided to hold the <a href="#agm12dec1979">AGM
            on Wednesday 12 December, 1979</a>.</p>
        <p>Bill McConnachie asked for nominations for the Committee to be handed
          in as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>The Chairman asked if there was any other business. There being none;
          he thanked everyone attending.</p>
        <p>The Meeting expressed their thanks to Malcolm for attending at such
          short notice.</p>
        <p>The Meeting closed at 2105.</p>

          House, Incle Street on Wednesday 12 December 1979.</p>
        <p>The meeting commenced at 8 pm. It was suggested that a Chairman be
          elected. Bill McConnachie read the Agenda and proposed Malcolm Crowe
          be Chairman.</p>
        <p>Malcolm asked if all were aware of the proposed constitution. Bill
          read the constitution and asked for amendments.</p>
        <p>Malcolm told us that the National Executive Council will indicate
          which area this Branch will cover and went on to speak about NEC
          powers.</p>
        <p>It was proposed that ten members or one-third of the membership,
          whichever is the less, shall constitute a Quorum. This was accepted by
          the meeting. It was then proposed that a majority of the Committee
          shall constitute a Quorum. This also was accepted.</p>
        <p>Bill proposed that the constitution, as amended be accepted This was
          done.</p>
        <p>The following members were proposed for the Committee and were

        <p style="text-decoration: none">A New Branch of S.H.R.G. Has been
          formed in Paisley, and the National Executive Committee has designated
          its geographical area as Renfrewshire and Ayrshire. As you are
          resident in this area, you are invited to become a member of the new
          Branch.</p>
        <p style="text-decoration: none">Meetings are held every Wednesday
          evening in A.U.E.W. House, 7 Incle Street, Paisley. Future meetings
          are as follows:</p>
        <p style="text-decoration: none">March 12: Talk by a speaker from the
          Socialist Party of Great Britain<br>

        <p style="text-decoration: none">New members would be made most welcome.
          Volunteers are needed to assist in helping to organise meetings and
          outings, and in many other ways.</p>
        <p style="text-decoration: none">Changing your Branch would have no
          effect on the meetings of either the Paisley or the Glasgow Branch
          that you are able to attend, and, just as at present, you would have
          free access to the Glasgow Gay Centre. But it means that you would
          have voting rights in Paisley instead of in Glasgow, would be eligible
          for election to the Paisley Branch Committee, and would be able to
          participate in strengthening what is still a very new section of the
          national organisation.</p>
        <p style="text-decoration: none">We therefore urge you to think
          seriously about whether you should make this change.</p>

          to Editor, Paisley Daily Express, re fair coverage&nbsp; on June 8,
          1981 of the Open Day marking the start of Renfrewshire and Ayrshire
          Gay Switchboard, and how grateful we are to Councilor Irene Gilgallon
          and the Rev. Johnstone McKay for their generous support. [Attached to
          LAMBDA No 6 July-August [1981]]</p>
        <p>The two so-called Christian correspondents, who wrote in such angry
          terms on June 12th, want to condemn their fellow-men, not for what
          they do, but what they are for the way they are made--a profoundly
          unChristian attitude. The Switchboard exists to help those who are,
          and always have been, homosexual; it is not concerned with those
          who,althouh by nature heterosexual, turn to intercourse with their own
          sex just for kicks (which is what St. Paul is talking about in his
          Epistle to the Romans.)</p>
        <p>Finally, I should like to point out that it is the gay publicity an
          who has his name and photograph appear on your front-page, whereas the
          two hostile correspondents both choose to remain anonymous. So which
          side is it that has the courage of its convictions, and dares stand up
          and be counted. </p>
        <p>Yours sincerely, David Jago.</p>

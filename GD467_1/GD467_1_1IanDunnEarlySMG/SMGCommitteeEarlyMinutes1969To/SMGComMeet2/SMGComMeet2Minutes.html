          <p><strong>THE HOMOSEXUAL IN SCOTLAND<a name="Summary6Mar1969" id="Summary6Mar1969"></a></strong></p>
        <p><strong>A summary of my report of the second meeting of individuals to discuss
          the position of the homosexual in Scotland.</strong></p>
        <p>The meeting was held in 13 Buckingham Street, Glasgow, from 7.30
          to 10pm on Thursday 6 March 1969. We met to debate the developments since the first meeting of 7 February 1969; to discuss our won lines of action; and to come to a conclusion about ourselves &quot;as a body&quot;.</p>
        <p>Each person, who had something to say, described their &quot;field of activity&quot; ... My first action was to visit Antony Gary in London on Friday 14 February [1969]. The meeting lasted over 2 hours and was very fruitful. A heave work-load locally had muted Albany Trust activities in Scotland. A.G's own proposal is that, shoudl we decide to act in unison, perhaps as &quot;A.T. supporters in Scotland&quot;, we should let him know. He would then notify all Scottish supporters and ask the, to get in touch with the Scottish Group. It woudl then be &quot;up to us&quot;. A.G. gave me two addresses and I contacted both persons. They are Mrs Kathleen Raby and Ean Simpson.</p>
        <p>Mrs Raby is Casework Suprevison and Tutor at the City of Glasgow Society of Social Services, Bath Street. THis is a voluntary organisation undergoing fundamental change under Mrs Ray. Mrs Raby has done personal casework (sexual difficulties) in Liverpool, and is astonished just how far behind we are in Glasgow. We spent about 2 hours in discussion 6 March 1969. For the present I shall simply pass on rReports of our meetings, as she has a defty admin. job to execute.</p>
        <p>Ean Simpson's present at the meeting was very much appreciated. He has just been nominated&nbsp; Cahirman of his Presbytery Committee of Moral Welfare, which means that he inherits a seat on the National Committee (of Social and Moral Welfare). He very much wants Antony Gray to vistit Scotland, and will make representations. Ean has been counselling homosexuals in the West Scotland aread (A.T. referral).</p>
        <p>A note from Allan Horsfall, Secretary NW-HLRC, was received 24 February 1969. He said that he is trying to find us a Scottish lawyer, and indeed there have been developments - of which a full repont will be made at our next meeting. An &quot;ESQUIRE&quot; meeting in Bolton on 21 February went off quite well. They have an option on premises there, and discussions with the Local Authorities continue.</p>
        <p>Within our own Group, Donald Brooks has been in touch with the Muir Society, and has been keeping an invaluable eye on the &quot;quality&quot;&nbsp; Scottish Dailies (Glasgow Herald/Scotsman). Jim Halcrow has been active in Civil Liberties. He will shortly be getting in touch with Esme Langley of a nationwide lesbian organisation, and is in correspondence with several other people.</p>
        <p><u>DECISIONS</u> which have crystallised from our discussions.</p>
        <p>1. OURSELVES AS A BODY. Jim Halcorw propsed Colin Harvey as Chairman. Ian Dunn seconded. Colin Harvey proposed myself as Secretary. Ted Macdonald seconded. We decided to contiue these meetings. All costs have been met voluntarily to date. As from 6 March 1969 they will be shared.</p>
        <p>2. ALBANY TRUST. We decided to ask Antony Gray if he will write to Trust supporters in Scotland, and to use this report (the full version ) as a basis for a visit to Scotland once opinion has been established.</p>
        <p>3. DATE AND PLACE OF NEXT MEETING. Friday 9 May 1969 7.30pm at 21, Hillhead Street, Glasgow, W.2. Full tribute must be paid to my parent's contribution to the success of the earlier meetings. Individually, everyone is most welcome at &quot;No 13&quot; - but serious groupwork must continue elsewhere.</p>
        <p>[signed] Ian C. Dunn. (IAN C DUNN) Secretary.</p>
